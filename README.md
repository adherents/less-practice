# LESS-practice

Current project was developed with the learning purpose. 
One of the free PSD landing page template was created through the use of LESS preprocessor and Gulp toolkit. To overcome CSS global scoping I used OOCSS. During creation of the template I adhered to the responsive design. Run `npm install` and `gulp` for a dev server.
